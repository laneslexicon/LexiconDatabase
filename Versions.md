## 1.0.9

There are no data changes in this version, but an error stopeed Lane's cross-references (entries in the text preceded by a down-arrow) from appearing as clickable links (they still appeared but as plain text).

This bug had been present for some time. :-(

## 1.0.8

#### Missing root <span lang="ar">دبر</span>


Derived forms of the root <span lang="ar">دبر</span> were assigned to root <span lang="ar">دبخ</span>.

The individual entries could be found in the Lexicon, except for the form 5 word <span lang="ar">تَدَبَّرَ</span> which was incorrectly inserted as <span lang="ar">تَدَبَّخَ</span>.

#### Missing root <span lang="ar">جسو</span>


Derived forms of the root <span lang="ar">جسو</span> were assigned to root <span lang="ar">جسم</span>.

Although they could be found in the body of the Lexicon, they appeared in the wrong place in the root/headword tree.


#### Typo in entry <span lang="ar">بُلَعٌ </span> (Node n3198).

There is an error in the text at the first line of Volume 1, page 250.


as they assert, (S,) when God said,<span lang="ar"> يَا أَرْضُ ٱبْلضعِى مَآءَكِ [Kur xi. 46]</span>; (S, K;)

Changed to read:

as they assert, (S,) when God said,<span lang="ar">يَا أَرْضُ ٱبْلعِى مَآءَكِ</span> [Kur xi. 46]; (S, K;)
