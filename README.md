# LexiconDatabase

The releases of this repository contains that latest version of the data that makes up the Arabic-English Lexicon.
From time to time users report errors/omissions; when the fixes have been made to the underlying data, a new version is released.

To update an existing version, download the latest release and extract/unzip to create a file named "lexicon.sqlite" and overwrite your existing copy with this new file.
